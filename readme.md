# Wgpu Template

This is just a template for using Rust + Winit + Wgpu to build native desktop programs. It was originally created by following the [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) tutorial, but I've completely restructured everything and added many features.

## NOTE: Even though I'd like for this to work on any OS, only Windows is tested for now.
